Target Even Elements Using jQuery

You can also target elements based on their positions using :odd or :even selectors.

Note that jQuery is zero-indexed which means the first element in a selection has a position of 0. This can be a little confusing as, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element (position 1), fourth element (position 3), and so on.

Here's how you would target all the odd elements with class target and give them classes:

$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");
